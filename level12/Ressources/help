you have another perl script that is a server

the exploit is obvious as it is executing the parameter x. The problem is that this parameter
is being transformed with 2 regex one turns everything upper case and the another one remove everything after first space, meaning that
we cant use getflag > /tmp/password

Buuuuut we can create an script named GETFLAG that contains getflag > /tmp/password, and
send to the server localhost:4646?x='$(/*/getflag)&y="" this will execute /*/GETFLAG and wola
