see /var/mail there is something there, there is an email with a cron job

if you go to the path shown in the cronjob you find an script, that executes each x time
all files in the path /opt/openarenaserver, if you put a file there that execute getflag and save it on another file you only need to
wait for the openarenaserver take that file and execute it, once the file has dissapear from there, its done

for example:

getflag > /tmp/password
