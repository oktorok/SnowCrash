im not sure even if this is the correct solution, but it works.

Anyway i didnt found anithing anyware then i gdb the getflag binary and disassemble it, seeing the asm orders i saw
that the program uses getuid hence i supposed all the rules JE (the rule JE on asm means that if is equal jumps somewhere and
if not jumps to another place) are checking the uid of the user. then i began to check them with gdb and "ju *<memmory direction>" hence i counted 14 je i tried the 14th and, yep, it worked.

i dont see any reason for dont do this in all the other levels :/ but anyway c'est fini
